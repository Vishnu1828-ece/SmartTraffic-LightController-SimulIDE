# Smart Traffic Light Controller

This project demonstrates a smart traffic light controller for a two-road junction using Arduino Mega simulated in SimulIDE.

## Components
- Arduino Mega 2560
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Resistors
- SimulIDE

## Working Principle
- Road One and Road Two traffic lights are controlled automatically.
- When one road shows GREEN, the other shows RED.
- Yellow light indicates transition.
- Timing is controlled using Arduino delay logic.

## Applications
- Smart city traffic control
- Embedded systems learning
- Arduino practice projects
