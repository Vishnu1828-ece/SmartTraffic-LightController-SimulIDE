# SmartTraffic-LightController-SimulIDE
The Smart Traffic Light Controller is an embedded systems project designed to simulate the operation of a real-world traffic signal at a two-road junction. The system is implemented using an Arduino Mega 2560 and simulated in SimulIDE, allowing the functionality to be tested without physical hardware.
